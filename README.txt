iGene Sdn Bhd Technical Challenge

Create a web application something similar like the logic in digitalocean.com with 
a create droplet page, list of droplets created (on or off) and billing page.

1. I used HTML and CSS for the front-end.
2. I am supposed to use JAVA for the back-end, unfortunately I have limited knowledge on that area.
   For future work, I should learn more about backend web development. 

Installation
Go to https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/ to install IntelliJ IDEA. 

Tests
To run the program, copy and paste all the source code into 6 different files:

1. frontpage.html
2. frontpagecss.css
3. login.html
4. logincss.css
5. billing.html
6. bill.css

Hit the run button to run the frontpage.html. The program will open the Chrome browser (or any other browser) and 
it should display the home page of the website. Click "Log in" at the navigation bar and it will redirect to
the log in menu. After the user enter the log in information and hit the log in button, it will again redirect to
the billing page.
